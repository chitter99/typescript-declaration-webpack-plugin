# typescript-declaration-webpack-plugin
Bundles typescript declarations generated by typescript loaded into one .d.ts file.

Import will be sorted so that each module or package is only imported once.

```
"declaration": true
```

## Webpack Plugin
Add the following to your webpack.config.js file.

```
const TypescriptDeclarationPlugin = require('typescript-declaration-webpack-plugin');
...
plugins: [
  new TypescriptDeclarationPlugin({
    out: 'yeti-table.d.ts'
  })
]
...
```
